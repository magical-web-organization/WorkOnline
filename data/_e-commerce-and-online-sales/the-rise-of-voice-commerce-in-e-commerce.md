In the current age of technology, E-commerce has experienced rapid growth, with more and more consumers turning to online shopping. Recent advancements in voice technology have given birth to a new trend known as voice commerce. Voice commerce is turning out to be the new normal in the world of e-commerce, and companies are focusing on developing a voice-activated shopping experience. In this article, we explore the rise of voice commerce in e-commerce and its impact on the industry.

## What is Voice Commerce?

Voice commerce, also known as v-commerce, is the process of using voice-activated assistants, like Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant, to search and order products from online or physical stores. Voice recognition technology has made it easy for customers to access a store's inventory or buy products online by simply using their voice. Users can browse products, add items to their shopping carts, and make a purchase using voice commands.

## The Growth of Voice Commerce

The use of voice-activated assistants has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it has had a significant impact on online shopping. A report by OC&C Strategy Consultants shows that voice commerce sales in the US and UK grew from $2 billion in 2017 to $40 billion by 2022. This rapid growth is mainly due to the convenience and speed of using voice search technology, which has made the shopping experience more personalized.

## Benefits of Voice Commerce for Retailers

Voice commerce provides retailers with a significant opportunity to improve their customer experience while boosting sales. Here are some ways in which voice commerce benefits retailers:

### Enhanced Customer Experience

Voice commerce provides a more accessible and personalized experience for customers, who can use natural language to browse and select products. Using voice assistants like Alexa, buyers can quickly order products and get them delivered to their doorstep without the need for keyboarding or manually clicking on products.

### Improved Sales

Voice commerce can help retailers to improve their conversion rates by providing shoppers with a more intuitive and efficient shopping experience. A voice-activated search is fast and precise, which means customers can find the products they want more easily. With more streamlined checkout processes, retailers can generate more sales.

### Better Customer Insights

Retailers can capture more information about their customers' purchasing behaviors and preferences by examining voice transaction data. This information is crucial to help retailers to personalize their offerings, improve their customer retention, and drive loyalty.

## Future of Voice Commerce

The growth of voice commerce is set to continue over the coming years as more customers adopt voice assistants. Retailers have already started integrating voice recognition technology into their online stores, and investment in voice technology is also on the rise. It is projected that by 2025, over 75% of US households will have a voice-enabled assistant, which means that voice commerce will be the future of e-commerce.

## Conclusion

The rise of voice commerce in e-commerce is an opportunity that retailers can't afford to ignore. With the convenience of voice technology, retailers can deliver a more personalized shopping experience to their customers, improve sales and gain valuable insights into their purchasing behaviors. As voice commerce continues to grow, retailers need to adapt by incorporating voice technology into their e-commerce strategies to provide a seamless customer experience.
