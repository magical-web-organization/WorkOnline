1. Freelancing Platforms: Many freelance platforms, such as Upwork, Freelancer, and Fiverr, have a large pool of clients looking for video editing services. You can create a profile on these platforms and showcase your skills and experience. Be sure to regularly update your portfolio and customer feedback to attract more clients.
