## What is Real Estate Investing?

Real estate investing involves purchasing, owning, managing, renting or selling of land, buildings or other real estate properties. This can be a great way to earn passive income over time, as real estate values tend to increase over time.

- Residential real estate - This includes single-family homes, apartments, and townhouses
- Commercial real estate – This includes office buildings, retail stores, and warehouses
- Industrial real estate – This includes manufacturing facilities and distribution centers
- Raw land – This includes undeveloped land that can be used for future development
