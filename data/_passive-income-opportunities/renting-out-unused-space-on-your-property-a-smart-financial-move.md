Are you currently living in a property with some unused space? It could be an extra room or an entire garage. Did you know that you can rent out that space and increase your income? Renting out unused space on your property is a smart way to make an extra buck without too much effort. Here are some tips on how to get started:

## Identify the Unused Space

Before you start renting out the unused space, assess what space you can part with realistically. You don't want to end up disrupting your life or inconveniencing your family. Look around your property and identify the space that can be rented out without causing any trouble. It's also crucial to make any necessary repairs or upgrades to ensure the space is clean, structurally sound, and safe.

## Determine Your Rental Price

Once you've identified the space, it's time to figure out how much rent you want to charge. Research the current rental prices in your desired location to get an idea of what the going rate is. You could also consult with a real estate agent in your area to see whether they have any insights. Be wary of overpricing your space as that could deter potential renters. 

## Find the Right Tenant

It's essential to find the right person to rent your space to. Draft a clear rental agreement and set standards that can guide you as you search for the right tenant. Consider conducting background checks on potential tenants to ensure the space is rented out to responsible people.

## Advertise Your Space

Now that you have everything in place, it's time to advertise your space. You can post ads online on platforms such as Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or even your local newspaper classifieds. You can also put up signs in your neighborhood. Be sure to include details such as the rental price, location, size, and features of the space.

## Market Your Space

After advertising your rental space, you may also have to market it to reach potential renters effectively. Create engaging marketing material that highlights the unique features of your rental space. For example, if you're renting out a garage, focus on its size, accessibility, and security.

## Keep The Space Maintained

To ensure tenants stay in your rental space for longer, it's essential to keep it maintained. Ensure the space is cleaned, and there are no plumbing or electrical issues. Keep in contact with your tenant to address any issues that may arise.

## In conclusion

Renting out unused space can be a viable source of income in today's economic climate. By working within the legal requirements and taking the necessary precautions, renting out space can be a win-win situation for both parties. Why not give it a try? You may be surprised at how much cash you can generate with the space you already have.
