## Risks of Investing in Websites and Online Businesses

1. Market Volatility: Just like any other investment, investing in websites and online businesses comes with its fair share of market risk. Trends can change quickly or evolve into different niches.

2. Quality of the Site or Business: There's always a risk that the website or online business you invest in may not meet your expectations or have a reliable income structure. Due diligence before investing, helpful metrics could be sales, daily/weekly/monthly income, web traffic source, ad income, etc.

3. Dependence on Third Parties: Online businesses' income sources such as ad revenue, affiliate income, and other incomes can change over time, and the investments always depend on the platform that provides the revenue.

4. Acquire the Site or Business: Once you've done your due diligence and identified a sound investment opportunity, you can make an offer or bid. Ensure that you have all of the necessary legal paperwork and contracts in place and confirm that the selling party has all legal rights to sell the business.
